# Division_nonrest
It is the hardware implementation of non restoring division alogrithm in Verilog which is analyzed through waveforms It provide division of two N bit no. in less time complexity(can be more modefied by redusing one state). In the picture I performed division of No. 7 and 3 and get the result in register Q(Quotient) and register A(remainder).)
